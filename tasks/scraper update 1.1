Lets update the scraper.
Currently it's only fetching from 3 fast food places.
We've made another service, a crawler, that's supposed to crawl all possible fast food places' websites and figure out where the information about offers is.
scraper\website_crawler.py

but it's not working correctly. Please expand on and fix the crawler so that we can read from all 
of the fast food places in:
scraper\fastfood-info.json

Also in kfc scraper figure out why prices are wrong, they should be 4549, 10999, 7899, 2599 and 4999



Also to better detect from the description of an offer what food it contains, use this llm chatbot from g4f. Here is example usage:

from g4f.client import Client

client = Client()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    web_search=False
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
